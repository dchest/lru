Go package cache implements LRU (Least Recently Used) cache algorithm.

Cache capacity can be optionally limited by both size in bytes and a number
of items. Items can keep track of their modification and access time.

INSTALLATION

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Some code structure ideas are inspired by YouTube's Vitess implementation of
LRU cache, but no code was taken from it:
